# Section Intro

This section will be an introduction to all of the main fundamentals of React. Things like components, props, state, and events. We'll be creating a very small rating feedback app to demonstrate these concepts.

My goal here is to just give you a taste of what React is and how it works. If you have any base knowledge in React, you will probably know the majority of this stuff. You can either skip it or you can use it as a refresher. We'll be diving into each of these topics in much more detail in the next few sections and in the projects. I think it's a good idea to gradually introduce these concepts so you can get a feel for how they work and how they all fit together. If you get confused, don't worry! This stuff will be drilled into your head by the end of this course.

## Topics Covered

- Quick React Setup: We're going to look at multiple environments to use React in. I'm going to start with the most basic setup which is the CDN. You wouldn't use this in production, however, I think it will help you have a better understanding of React overall. We're even going to use React without JSX just to see what that looks like.
- JSX (JavaScript XML): Then we'll move to JSX, which is JavaScript XML. I'll show you how much easier it makes creating React components.
- Vite Web Development Server: After the first couple videos, we'll move to using Vite, which is a very powerful dev tool and server. 
- Components: We'll look at component-based development and how to create UI components
- Styling Components: We'll look at CSS styling with React
- Lists & Keys: We'll learn how to create lists
- Event Handling: Handle events
- What Are Hooks? I'll give you an intro to hooks and we'll be working with component state and the useState hook
- State & useState Hook
- Conditional Styling
- Props
- Component Composition, we'll look at breaking things down into smaller reusable components.

The project for this section is extremely simple, but it's definitely not about the poject. I just wanted to teach these concepts and have something to show for it. Again, this is not a project-based course where we create one single project. It's made up of about a dozen smaller projects with a specific purpose.

As far as the functionality, it's very simple:


✅ Click on stars to set a rating (1–5)
✅ Hover over stars for preview effect
✅ Displays dynamic feedback message based on rating
✅ Uses CSS animations & transitions for a polished UI
