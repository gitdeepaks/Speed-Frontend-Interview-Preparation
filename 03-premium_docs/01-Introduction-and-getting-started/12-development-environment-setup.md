# Development Environment Setup

In this lesson, we will set up our development environment. Since we are working in the frontend, there isn't much we need to setup. We don't need any hardcore compilers or build tools. We can just use a simple text editor and a browser along with a few extensions.

## Node.js

First off, you need to make sure that you have Node.js installed on your system. Node is a JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript on your machine. You can build server-side applications with JavaScript. We'll look into using React with Node.js later in the course with something called the MERN stack, but the main reason we need it now is because it comes with NPM, which is the Node Package Manager. NPM is a package manager that allows you to install packages and libraries that you can use in your projects. We'll use this to setup React and install 3rd-party packages for things like routing, alerts, etc. You can download Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

## Text Editor

You can use any text editor you'd like. I highly recommend using Visual Studio Code. It's free, open-source, and has a lot of extensions that can help you with your development. You can download it from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/). This is what I'll be using throughout the course. I will show you a few of the extensions that I use and recommend as well.

## Git

You should also have Git installed on your system. Git is a version control system that allows you to keep track of your code changes. You can download Git from [here](https://git-scm.com/). In order to deploy your projects, you'll need to use Git to push your code to a repository on GitHub or GitLab. We'll look into this later in the course.

## Browser

Of course you need a browser. Which one you use is completely up to you. I'll be using Chrome throughout the course. I recommend using Chrome or Firefox. They have great developer tools that can help you debug your code. However, you can use any browser you'd like.

## Browser Extensions

There are a few browser extensions that I recommend you install. The first one is the React Developer Tools extension. This extension allows you to inspect the React component hierarchy in the Chrome Developer Tools. You can download it from [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi). It's also available for Firefox.

The next one is the Redux DevTools extension. This extension allows you to inspect every action and state change in your Redux application. You can download it from [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd). It's also available for Firefox.

## VS Code Extensions

There are a few VS Code extensions that I recommend you install. The first one is the Prettier - Code formatter extension. This extension allows you to format your code with a single click. You can download it from [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode).

The next one is called "Simple React Snippets". This extension provides you with a lot of snippets that you can use to quickly generate React components. You can download it from [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=burkeholland.simple-react-snippets).

I would suggest installing the "Dotenv" extension as well. This extension provides syntax highlighting for .env files. You can download it from [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mikestead.dotenv).

The JavaScript ES6 code snippets extension is also very useful. It provides you with a lot of ES6 snippets that you can use in your JavaScript files. You can download it from [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=xabikos.JavaScriptSnippets).

You can install more if you'd like, but these are the ones that I use and recommend. Also, if you are curious about my VS Code theme it's called "Github Dark+". You can download it from [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=StylishThemes.GitHubDark).
