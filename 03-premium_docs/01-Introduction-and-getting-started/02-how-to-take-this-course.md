# How To Take This Course

I just wanted to take a moment to share my thoughts on the different ways to take this course and how to get the most out of it.

## The "Just Watch" Approach

If you're just looking to watch the videos and not do any of the exercises, that's totally fine. You'll still learn a lot just by watching the videos. However, I would encourage you to at least try some of the projects as they will help reinforce what you've learned.

## The "Code Along" Approach

Next is the code along approach. This is where you watch the videos and code along with me as I create projects. This is a great way to learn as it forces you to think about what you're doing and why you're doing it. Even though I am showing you what to type, you still need to think about what you're doing and it will help you retain the information better.

## The "Watch & Practice" Approach

The watch and practice approach is more time consuming, however, it is one of the best way to learn. This is where you watch the videos and code along with me but then either add on to the projects with what you've learned or create your own projects using the concepts you've learned. This will help reinforce what you've learned and give you real world practice and experience. You can do this either during the course or just follow along as is and then after each section or after the entire course, go back and add things or create your own projects.

It's up to you on how you want to take this course. It depends on the time that you have available and how you learn best. I would encourage you to at least try the code along approach as I think it's much more valuable than just watching the videos.

## Skill Level

This course is appropriate for both absolute beginners as well as React intermediates. The reason it's good for beginners is that we start from scratch and teach the fundamentals. You're not expected to know anything but HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We even have a JavaScript refresher for modern features that are used a lot in React development.

The reason that it is appropriate for React intermediates is because even though we start from scratch, we are using React in different environments with different tools such as React Router v7 and TanStack. You may know React, but you may not know these tools and these environments to use React in. So it's going to expand your knowledge. If you already know the basics about state, props, events, etc, feel free to skip those sections and jump into another part of the course. We do a bunch of different isolated projects in this course, so that's fine to do.

## Premium Docs

I have included a written version of the entire course called the "Premium Docs". This will have all code samples and written explanation. I spend a lot of time doing this but it really seems to help some people. It also helps me keep track of what I am doing. You can find the download in this section. It is comprised of a bunch of formatted markdown files. Use it as a supplement to the videos.


## Getting Help

As far as help goes, I encourage you to try and solve problems on your own first. This is how you learn and grow as a developer. Make sure that you check the console for errors. You wouldn't believe how many people don't check for errors when it exactly what's wrong and even gives you the line number. Use documentation and even AI tools like ChatGPT or Claude. This will give you real world experience because you won't always have someone to ask for help and you have to find it on your own.

However, if you're really stuck, there are a few things you can do:

- If you're taking the course on Udemy, you can use the Q/A. We have paid helpers and other students who can help you out.
- If you purchased the course from traversymedia.com, you should have access to the Discord server where you can ask questions and get help.
