# Section Intro

In this section, we will talk about the build process that a React single-page application goes through before it is deployed to a server. We will also discuss the deployment process and the different ways to deploy a React application. We will be using a service called Vercel to deploy our React applications. Vercel is a cloud platform that enables developers to host websites and web services that deploy instantly. It is a great platform for deploying React applications and the free tier is more than enough for projects like this.

In the next video, I want to discuss the build process and what that actually means.
