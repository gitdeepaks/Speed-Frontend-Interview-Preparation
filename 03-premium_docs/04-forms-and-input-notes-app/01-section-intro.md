# Section Intro

In this section, we will be working with forms and input fields. We will be creating a simple notes app where users can create and manage notes. We'll also be using Tailwind CSS for stying.

We're going to discuss the following topics:

- Controlled vs Uncontrolled Components. This is a fundamental concept in React. Controlled components are those whose value is controlled by React state, while uncontrolled components are those whose value is controlled by the DOM.
- Form validation
- Form Submission and event handling
- Creating reusable components
- Form UI state such as making the form collapsible, loading state, and error state.
- Conditional rendering
- Prop drilling and lifting state up
